# Select legacy `WORKSPACE` builds vs Bzlmod builds. Remove once Bazel 9 becomes
# the minimum supported version, since it only supports Bzlmod.
#
# --enable_bzlmod defaults to `false` in Bazel 6 and `true` in Bazel 7.
# --noenable_bzlmod ensures Bazel does _not_ create an empty MODULE.bazel file
# when it doesn't already exist.
#
# --enable_workspace defaults to `true` in Bazel 7 and `false` in Bazel 8.
# It doesn't exist in Bazel 6, and setting it causes Bazel 6 to break, which is
# why `tools/bazel` makes Bazel 6 ignore it.
